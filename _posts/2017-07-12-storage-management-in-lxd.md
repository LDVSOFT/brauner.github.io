#### Introduction

For a long time LXD has supported multiple storage drivers. Users could choose
between zfs, btrfs, lvm, or plain directory storage pools but they could only
ever use a single storage pool. A frequent feature request was to support not
just a single storage pool but multiple storage pools. This way users would for
example be able to maintain a zfs storage pool backed by an SSD to be used by
very I/O intensive containers and another simple directory based storage pool
for other containers. Luckily, this is now possible since LXD gained its own
storage management API a few versions back.

#### Creating storage pools

A new LXD installation comes without any
storage pool defined. If you run `lxd init` LXD will offer to create a storage
pool for you. The storage pool created by `lxd init` will be the default
storage pool on which containers are created.

#### Creating further storage pools

Our client tool makes it really simple to
create additional storage pools. In order to create and administer new storage
pools you can use the `lxc storage` command. So if you wanted to create an
additional btrfs storage pool on a block device `/dev/sdb` you would simply use
`lxc storage create my-btrfs btrfs source=/dev/sdb`. But let's take a look:

#### Creating containers on the default storage pool

If you started from a fresh install of LXD and created a storage pool via `lxd
init` LXD will use this pool as the default storage pool. That means if you're
doing a `lxc launch images:ubuntu/xenial xen1` LXD will create a storage volume
for the container's root filesystem on this storage pool. In our examples we've
been using `my-first-zfs-pool` as our default storage pool:

#### Creating containers on a specific storage pool

But you can also tell `lxc launch` and `lxc init` to create a container on
a specific storage pool by simply passing the `-s` argument. For example, if
you wanted to create a new container on the `my-btrfs` storage pool you would
do `lxc launch images:ubuntu/xenial xen-on-my-btrfs -s my-btrfs`:

#### Creating custom storage volumes

If you need additional space for one of your containers to for example store
additional data the new storage API will let you create storage volumes that
can be attached to a container. This is as simple as doing `lxc storage volume
create my-btrfs my-custom-volume`:

Attaching custom storage volumes to containers

Of course this feature is only helpful because the storage API let's you attach
those storage volume to containers. To attach a storage volume to a container
you can use `lxc storage volume attach my-btrfs my-custom-volume xen1 data
/opt/my/data`:

#### Sharing custom storage volumes between containers

By default LXD will make an attached storage volume writable by the container
it is attached to. This means it will change the ownership of the storage
volume to the container's id mapping. But Storage volumes can also be attached
to multiple containers at the same time. This is great for sharing data among
multiple containers. However, this comes with a few restrictions. In order for
a storage volume to be attached to multiple containers they must all share the
same id mapping. Let's create an additional container `xen-isolated` that has
an isolated id mapping. This means its id mapping will be unique in this LXD
instance such that no other container does have the same id mapping. Attaching
the same storage volume `my-custom-volume` to this container will now fail:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/128588.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/128588)

But let's make `xen-isolated` have the same mapping as `xen1` and let's also
rename it to `xen2` to reflect that change. Now we can attach
`my-custom-volume` to both `xen1` and `xen2` without a problem:

#### Summary

The storage API is a very powerful addition to
LXD. It provides a set of essential features that are helpful in dealing with
a variety of problems when using containers at scale. This short introducion
hopefully gave you an impression on what you can do with it. There will be more
to come in the future.
